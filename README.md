# PGRX Web Server

This project is an experiment to run a web server from a Postgres extension.

It uses the [PGRX framework](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx) and aims to clone the functionality of [PostgREST](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest).
Currently, it generates a simple asynchronous web server and validates JWT.
